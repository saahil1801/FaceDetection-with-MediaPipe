# FaceDetection-with-MediaPipe

This project demonstrates how to perform face detection using [MediaPipe](https://mediapipe.dev/) and [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/). Face detection is the process of identifying and locating human faces in an image or video. This project uses the MediaPipe Face Detection model to identify faces in images and draw bounding boxes around them.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following requirements:

- Python
- OpenCV (cv2)
- MediaPipe
- Matplotlib

##How it Works
First, we load an image using OpenCV.

We convert the BGR image to RGB format for compatibility with MediaPipe and Matplotlib.

Using the MediaPipe Face Detection model, we process the image to detect faces.

The detected faces are provided as a list of bounding box coordinates, which include the relative positions of the top-left and bottom-right corners.

We iterate over the detected faces and draw green bounding boxes around them using OpenCV.

We convert the image back to RGB format for displaying using Matplotlib.

The annotated image is displayed, showing the detected faces with bounding boxes.

##Usage
To use this project, follow these steps:

Clone the repository or download the code to your local machine.

Install the required packages (as mentioned in the prerequisites).

Replace path-to-your-image.png with the path to your image in the README file.

###Run the code using Python:

bash
Copy code
python your_face_detection_script.py
You can also use this code within a Jupyter Notebook for interactive testing.

##Results
The result will be an image with bounding boxes drawn around detected faces, like the example shown above.

##Contributing
Contributions are welcome! If you find any issues or want to improve the project, please create a pull request or open an issue.
